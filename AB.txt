The set interface present in the java.util package and extends the Collection interface is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored. It is an interface which implements the mathematical set. This interface contains the methods inherited from the Collection interface and adds a feature which restricts the insertion of the duplicate elements. There are two interfaces which extend the set implementation namely SortedSet and NavigableSet.
